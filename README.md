# Horiseon

## Description 

This is a website for Horiseon, an online and digital marketing agency here to help brands and companies with social media marketing, managing their online reputation and search engine optimization.  

In the latest iteration of this webiste, we have endeavoured to improve the accessibility of the website. The main motivation for this was to provide all users with a positive experience whilst browsing  the website.

## Installation





## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)
